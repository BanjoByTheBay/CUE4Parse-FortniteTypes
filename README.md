# CUE4Parse FortniteTypes extensions

I have created this mainly for myself, but it may be useful to others. This projects adds Fortnite-specific Objects,
Enums, and Structs to CUE4Parse for easier access to Fortnite types!

To register all classes used in this project, in your own project, use the line below

```c#
ObjectTypeRegistry.RegisterEngine(typeof(UFortItemDefinition).Assembly);
```
